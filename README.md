####What it is:<br />
  This is a python implementaion of HANDY: Human and Nature Dynamics. The model is described in the publication "Human and Nature Dynamics (HANDY): Modeling Inequality and Use of Resources in the Collapse or Sustainability of Societies" by Safa Motesharrei, Jorge Rivas, and Eugenia Kalnay a draft of which can be found at: http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ekalnay/pubs/2014-03-18-handy1-paper-draft-safa-motesharrei-rivas-kalnay.pdf . I make no claim to the intelectual content of the model, or that this is an accurate representation of it the original authors intent. I knocked this together over Saturday morning coffee because I thought it was interesting.
