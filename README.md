####What it is:<br />
  This is a python implementaion of the HANDY model: Human and Nature Dynamics. The model is described in the publication "Human and Nature Dynamics (HANDY): Modeling Inequality and Use of Resources in the Collapse or Sustainability of Societies" by Safa Motesharrei, Jorge Rivas, and Eugenia Kalnay a draft of which can be found at: http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ekalnay/pubs/2014-03-18-handy1-paper-draft-safa-motesharrei-rivas-kalnay.pdf . I make no claim to the intelectual content of the model, or that this is an accurate representation of it the original authors intent. I knocked this together over Saturday morning coffee because I thought it was interesting.


####requires:<br />
python<br />
numpy<br />
matplotlib (optional) <br />

####To use:<br />
  python Run_HANDY.py <parameter text file>


####Parameter files
  I have included a few parameter files corresponding to some of the specific cases described in the paper. The default parameter file is for the first case presented in the paper for an egalitarian society where the nature deletion factor is optimal.
